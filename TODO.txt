==========   BUGS     =====================
- If I change my default delivery location, it is applied only after refresh
- after deleting / closing orders in backoffice view, only the table with orders refreshes, need to refresh the table by articles as well

==========   TODO     =====================

- Re-enable saving / loading from cookies
- Refactor all Business contact information into properties / DB
	- change Contacts page to use properties values, not hardcoded contacts

- ordering time for pickup at OC Ruze


- General
	- All dates are displayed in UTC time
	- DB review - constraints, indexes, etc.
	- automated DB backup
	- Need to clearly identify common objects needed in all controllers and how they can be accessed
		- token
		- customer
		- reference data (delivery locations, etc)
	- main.js loads needed data in a sequential way (callback chain), but New order code uses $.when(..).done()
	- when to use static member functions and when prototype???
	- rename MenuService to something more appropriate
	- reafactor delivery location selector into a template
	- consider refactoring general message (after updates, ordering, etc) into one parametrizable message dialogue

- UI Consolidation
	- technique for building editable forms. Currently Register Customer uses tables, Refarral dialog uses DIVs.
	- extract stylesheets into multiple separate files to introduce more clarity
	- validations
		- currently same validations are coded individually (multiple times). E.g. email validation in registration and profile forms	
- Pickup and payment instructions
	- separate payment and pickup instructions fr each delivery location
		- currently only DHL implemented
		- currently only in the menu email, should these instructions be displayed on th Web as welll
	
- UI Localization / Language
	- Language toggle switch does not work in IE6
	- Currently UI shows the flag of the other language (to which language will bechanged after clicking) P2
		This is not intuitive as people expect it to show current setting. PLus it would not work if we had 3 languages. We need to implement some kind of a selector

- Article
	- Consider maintaining sort order of meals within a category

- Customer (DB)
	- add "created_on" (timestamp), so that we can track new customers
	- add "deactivated_on", to track when people unsubscribed

- Order
	- assigning of the timestamp must be reworked to be assigned by the app, so that the date is also available in Domain object (e.g. for email confirmation)  P4

- OrderItemDao
	- implement various different ordering options used in backoffice views (in different order) p4

- Login
	- Login does not work on production server. There seems to be some reference to localhost:8080 for login script	P2

- backoffice view
	- cooking overview
		- Table by articles - sort by category - rework to use OrderItem DAO
		
- Packaging Type	P4
	- create test data
	- modify INSERT script on google spreadsheet
	- displaying package type and ordering in views / reports

- Ordering
	- Find out how to publish ordering/pickup instructions
		- probably different instructions for each delivery location

- Referral dialog
	- add Default Delivery Location select box to define recipient's delivey location. P2

- Order Confirmation email
	- consider what other information needs to be included	P2


- Emailing general
	- refactor VM templates (mostly headers and footers) to use more templates with variables rather than clones of the same texts
		- introduce new variables (e.g. time of ordering, location)
	- introduce "standard" context variables for all emails

- Menu Emailing
	- Manual triggering of menu emailing, currently only as JSON URL but no UI	 P3

- Menu administration P4

	
- Different installation packages for DEV and PROD versions
	- Differences:
		- shop URL (localhost vs. www.lunch4you.cz)
		- emailing job enabled / disabled
		
		
- Maintenance
	- backup script with emailing for DB
