==========   BUGS     =====================
- when someone uses link for a meal which is not active at the moment, system does not give any message.


==========   TODO     =====================
- General
	- All dates are displayed in UTC time
	
- Pickup and payment instructions
	- separate payment and pickup instructions fr each delivery location
		- currently only DHL implemented
		- currently only in the menu email, should these instructions be displayed on th Web as welll
	
- UI Localization / Language
	- Language toggle switch does not work in IE6
	- Currently UI shows the flag of the other language (to which language will bechanged after clicking) P2
		This is not intuitive as people expect it to show current setting. PLus it would not work if we had 3 languages. We need to implement some kind of a selector

- Customer (DB)
	- add "created_on" (timestamp), so that we can track new customers
	- add "deactivated_on", to track when people unsubscribed

- Order
	- assigning of the timestamp must be reworked to be assigned by the app, so that the date is also available in Domain object (e.g. for email confirmation)  P4

- OrderItemDao
	- implement various different ordering options used in backoffice views (in different order) p4
